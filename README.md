The quickest way to get start with Node.Js & Express, just clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/arjunkhetia/Node.Js-Express-Project.git
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Start Express.js app at `http://localhost:3000/`:

```bash
$ npm start
```

# Nodemon

Nodemon will watch the files in the directory in which nodemon was started, and if any files change, nodemon will automatically restart your node application.

Start Express.js app with nodemon at `http://localhost:3000/`:

```bash
$ nodemon bin/www
```

# Logger - Morgan & Winston

Morgan - HTTP request logger middleware for node.js:

```js
var logger = require('morgan');
app.use(logger('dev'));
```

Winston - is designed to be a simple and universal logging library with support for multiple transports:

```js
var logger = require('winston');
```

# Rotating File Stream

To provide an automated rotation of Express/Connect logs or anything else that writes to a log on a regular basis that needs to be rotated based on date.

```js
var rfs    = require('rotating-file-stream');
var stream = rfs('file.log', {
    size:     '10M', // rotate every 10 MegaBytes written
    interval: '1d',  // rotate daily
    compress: 'gzip' // compress rotated files
});
```
